# webpack4-working-boilerplate  ✌ ☝ 🤚 👌 👍



this is webpack 4 boilerplate for transpiling js code with webpack cli setting 


however clone repo n say: npm i

after that u can type : npx run dev 
or npx webpack-dev-server

Enjoy! good to go! now go to Localhost://8080 open ua console n see the magic . its automated reloading and transpailing ua local code and bundling for client static assets.

Further: i am gonna do css-loader sass-loader style-loader and jsx transpiling using webpack rules: kindly if u are looking for this go to branches i am gonna update in branches!

thank you for now bubye! 👋
